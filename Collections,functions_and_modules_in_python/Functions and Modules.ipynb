Write a python function to check whether a number is perfect or not\n","> * # In number theory, a perfect number is a positive interger that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself.Equivalently, perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors.\n","\n","# B5.

What is lambda function in python?What we call a function which is incomplete version of a function?\n","\n","> * # Lambda Function, also referred to as 'Anonymous function' is same as a regular python function but can be defined without a name. While normal functions are defined using the def keyword, anonymous functions are defined using the lambda keyword\n","\n","# B7. How Many Basic Types Of Functions Are Available In Python?\n","\n","> * # There are two types of function in python\n","> * ## Built-in function, such as help(), print(), len(), type(), id() etc.\n","> * ## User defined function - we can define ourselves to do certain specific task are referred as user-defined functions.\n","\n","# I3. What is map function in Python?\n","> * # Map in python is a function that work as an iterator to return after applying a function to every item of an iterable (tuple,lists,etc). It is used when you want to apply a single transformation function to all the iterable elements.The iterable and function are passed as argument to the map in python.\n","\n","# I4. Does Python Have A Main() Method?\n","\n","> * # Since there is no main() function in python, when the command to run a python program is given to the interpreter,  the code that is at level() indentation is to be executed. However, before doing that, it will define a few special variable.\n","\n","# I5. What Does The *Args Do In Python?What Does The **Kwargs Do In Python? \n","\n","# Argument forms - Arbitrary Argument List\n","## These arguments will be wrapped up in a tuple and dictionary. Before the variable numbers of arguments, zero or more normal arguments may occur.\n","> ## 1. Arbitrary Positional Arguments -> *args | tuple\n","> > ## If you do not know how many arguments that will be passed into your function, add a * before the parameter name in the function definition.\n","> ## 2. Arbitrary Keyword Arguments -> **args | dict\n","> > ## If you do not know how many arguments that will be passed into your function, add two ** before the parameter name in the function definition.\n","\n","# I6. What Does The Name Do In Python?What Is The Purpose Of “End” In Python?\n","\n","> * # The end key of print function will set the string that needs to be appended when printing is done. By default the end key is set by newline character. So after finishing priting all the variables, a newline character is appended.\n","\n","# I7. What Does The Len() Function Do In Python? What Does The Ord() Function Do In Python?\n","\n","> * # The len() function the number of items in an object. when the object is a string, the len() function return the number of character in the string.\n","\n","# A1. Name few methods that are used to implement Functionally Oriented Programming in Python?\n","\n","> * # python offers two built-in functions, map()  and filter(), that fit the functional programming paradigm.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"3WyjFHG59-lt"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# B1.
