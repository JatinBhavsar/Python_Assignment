What is python,Name some of the feature of python.\n","> * #  python can be used to develop both desktop and web apps and complex scientific and numerical application. Pyhton data analysic feature help you create custom big data solution without so much time and effort. \n","\n","# B3. Is python the right choice for web based programming?\n","> * # The choice of framworks isn't overwhelming and you can create a sensible, reliable toolbox without worrying you're not using the lastest tech.So, ultimate, python is a great choice for web development.\n","\n","# B4. Why was the language called as python?\n","> * # When he begin implementing python, Guido van rossum was also reading the published script from \" Monty python flying circus\", a bcc comedy series from the 1970s. Van rossum though he needed a namee that was short, unique, and slightly mysterious, so he decided t call the language python.\n","\n","# B6. What is the language from which Python has got its features or derived its features? \n","\n","> * # python derived from many other language, including ABC, C, C++, Algol-68, SmallTalk, and Unix shell and other scripting language.\n","\n","# B8. Does python support switch or case statement in Python?If not what is the reason for the same?\n","> * # Unlike every other programming language we have used before, python does not have switch or case statement.To get around this fact, we can use dictionary mapping.\n","\n","# B9. How Python is interpreted?\n","> * # Python is an interpreted language, which means the source code of a python program is converted intp bytecode that is then executed by the python virtual machine. pyhton is different from major compilied language, such as C and C++, as python code is not requried to be built and linked like code for these language.\n","\n","# B12. How memory is managed in Python?\n","> * # Memory management in python involves a private heap containing all python objects and data structures. The management of this private heap is ensured heap isensured internally by the python memory manager.\n","\n","# B13. What is namespace in Python?\n","> * # Namespaces in python. A namespaces is a collection of currently defined symboilc names along with information about the object that each name references.You can think of a namespces as a dictionary in which the keys are the object names and the values.\n","\n","# B14. What is the purpose continue statement in python?\n","\n","> * # The continue keyword is used to end the current iterations in a foor loop or while loop, and continue to the next iteration.\n","\n","# I6. What are the tools that help to find bugs or perform static analysis? \n","\n","> * # Pychecker and pylint are the static analysis tools that help to find bugs in python. Pychecker is an opensources tool for static analysis that detects the bugs from sources code and warms about the styles and complexity of the bugs.\n","\n","# I7. What are Python decorators?\n","\n","> * # A decorate is a design pattern that allows a user to add new functionally to an existing object without modifying its structure. Decorators are usally called before the definition of a functions you want to decorate.\n","\n","# I8. What is PEP 8?\n","\n","> * # PEP 8, sometimes spelled PEP8 or PEP-8, is a document that provides that provides guidelines and best practices on how to write python code. It was written in 2001 by Guido van Rossum, Barry Warsaw, and Nick Coghlan. The primary focus of PEP8= 8 is to improve the readability and consistency of python code.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"SYbgbJHuJPIa"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# B2.
